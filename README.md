## Variant allele frequencies shaped by drift and selection in homeostatic tissues

FLORENCE predicts that drift and selection shape the variant allele frequency distribution distinctly. We predict VAF distributions for different parameter sets and time points in the script [Theoretical_model_performance.R](Analysis_and_figures/Theoretical_model_performance.R). The script also produces the figure panels **Figure 1c, f**, and **Figure S1a, b**.

## Simulated data

### Tree and VAF simulation

To test inference of drift and selection dynamics, we generated simulated division trees, generated simulated WGS data by binomial sampling of a simulated bulk and ran the model inference on these data. To reproduce the analysis, run the scripts [Neutral_tree.R](Simulated_data/Neutral_tree.R) and [Selected_tree.R](Simulated_data/Selected_tree.R) to simulate neutrally evolving trees and trees with a selected clone instigated at 20 years. The scripts source the scripts [Simulate_trees.R](Simulated_data/Simulate_trees.R) and [Tree_post_processing.R](Simulated_data/Tree_post_processing.R), which contain the modalities for tree simulation. Finally, to generate the VAF distributions which were used to assess the performance of FLORENCE, run [Study_design.R](Simulated_data/Study_design.R), which adds binomial noise to the simulated VAFs and generates the simulated data sets as outlined in (Metadata/Sample_information_simulated_data.xlsx).

### Parameter inference

To estimate the model parameters, we used FLORENCE in conjunction with pyABC. To re-run the analysis refer to the folder (Parameter_estimation) and modify Simulated_data/Run_model_sim*x.R according to the sample specification. Specifically, you should provide the following information:

- *patient.id*, the ID/name of the analyzed subject
- *age*, the age (in days)
- *snvs*, a named list containing data frames with VAF and Depth information for each individual 
- *depth*, the sequencing depth used to generate the data 
- *min.vaf*, the smallest VAF in the data that is to be compared to the model. Defaults to 0.05; we used 0.05 for all instances except for single cell WGS and simulated data with 270x, where we used 0.01.
- *min.clone.size*, the minimal clone size that can be detected by the model. Defaults to 0.05; we used 0.05 for all instances except for single cell WGS and simulated data with 270x, where we used 0.01.
- *min.prior.size*, the lower limit of clone sizes scanned by the parameter estimation. Parameter setzs associated with clones < min.clone.size will be evaluated with the neutral model. Defaults to 0.01; we used 0.01 for all instances except for single cell WGS and simulated data with 270x, where we used 0.001.
- *use.sensitivity* should sequencing sensitivity information be included in addition to binomial sampling? Defaults to F; if T, a matrix *false.negative.per.vaf* with columns corresponding to the measured VAFs and rows corresponding to individual measurements of the false negative rate at this VAF in addition to binomial noise must be provided. We used use.sensitivity=F.
  
### Analysis and plots

Upon parameter estimation, the posterior probabilities were analyzed using the script (Analyze_and_plot_fits_sim_data.R)[Analysis_and_figures/Analyze_and_plot_fits_sim_data.R]. This script 
- plots for each instance the model fit and the highest density estimates of each parameter
- computes statistics of the fits - %posterior probability supporting the selection model and the neutral model
- evaluates true and false positives for different clone sizes and sequencing depths, constructs the corresponding ROC curves and computes the AUC at the selected operating point
- this script generates the figure panels for **Fig. 1g-j** and **Fig. S1d-f**.

## Published single cell WGS data

We tested our model on pseudo-bulk WGS data from published single-cell WGS data of three studies, Lee-Six et al., Nature, 2018, Mitchell et al., Nature, 2022 and Fabre et al., 2022. In a first step, we generated the pseudo-bulks for each study as outlined in the following.

### Generation of pseudo-bulk data 

#### Lee-Six et al.
Download the data from https://doi.org/10.17632/yzjw2stk7f.1 and store them in ./Lee-Six_et_al/Caveman/. In addition, download the re-called data from our repository (**fill-in**) and store them in ./Lee-Six_et_al/Mutect_Strelka.

The script (Pseudo_VAFs_LeeSix_et_al.R)[Data_preprocessing/Pseudo_VAFs_LeeSix_et_al.R] first compares the results of Caveman and Mutect/Strelka (**Fig. S2b,c**). It progresses to generate the pseudo-bulk data and to plot the VAF distributions as shown in **Fig. 3b, S2X**. It also plots the trees as shown in **Fig. 3a**. Finally, it stores two list objects containing the VAFs in (Caveman/SNVs.RData)[RData/Lee-Six_et_al/Caveman/SNVs.RData] and (Mutect_Strelka/SNVs.RData)[RData/Lee-Six_et_al/Mutect_Strelka/SNVs.RData].

#### Mitchell et al.

Download the data from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/np54zjkvxr/1 and structure them like: ./Mitchell_et_al/*/.

The script (Pseudo_VAFs_Mitchell_et_al.R)[Data_preprocessing/Pseudo_VAFs_Mitchell_et_al.R] generates the pseudo-bulk data and plots the VAF distributions as shown in **Fig. 3f,l, Fig. S2d,e**. It also plots the trees as shown in **Fig. 3e,k**. Finally, it stores a list object containing the VAFs for each sample in (SNVs.RData)[RData/Mitchell_et_al/SNVs.RData].

#### Fabre et al.
Download the data of id2259 from [https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/np54zjkvxr/1](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.15029118) and structure them like: ./Fabre_et_al/*/.

The script (Pseudo_VAFs_Fabre_et_al.R)[Data_preprocessing/Pseudo_VAFs_Fabre_et_al.R] generates the pseudo-bulk data and plots the VAF distribution as shown in **Fig. XX**. It also plots the trees as shown in **Fig. XX**. Finally, it stores a list object containing the VAFs in (SNVs.RData)[RData/Fabre_et_al/SNVs.RData].

### Parameter inference

As with the simulated data, we used FLORENCE in conjunction with pyABC to estimate parameters. To re-run the analysis refer to the folder (Parameter_estimation) and modify Simulated_data/Run_model_sim*x.R according to the sample specification, with emphasis on the following information

- *patient.id*, the ID/name of the analyzed subject
- *age*, the age (in days)
- *snvs*, a named list containing VAF information for each individual 
- *depth*, the sequencing depth used to generate the data 
- *min.vaf*, the smallest VAF in the data that is to be compared to the model. Defaults to 0.05; we used 0.01 due to the high pseudo-bulk coverage.
- *min.clone.size*, the minimal clone size that can be detected by the model. Defaults to 0.05; we used 0.01 due to the high pseudo-bulk coverage.
- *min.prior.size*, the lower limit of clone sizes scanned by the parameter estimation. Parameter setzs associated with clones < min.clone.size will be evaluated with the neutral model.0.001 due to the high pseudo-bulk coverage.
- *ncells*, the number of sequenced cells
- *seq.type*, has to be set to "sc", as we analyze pseudo-bulks from single-cells
- *use.sensitivity* should sequencing sensitivity information be included in addition to binomial sampling? Defaults to F; if T, a matrix *false.negative.per.vaf* with columns corresponding to the measured VAFs and rows corresponding to individual measurements of the false negative rate at this VAF in addition to binomial noise must be provided. We used use.sensitivity=F.

In contrast to bulk WGS data sequenced at 90x, we here lowered the resolution a bit for the single-cell sequencing data. Moreover, we specify the number of sequenced cells and run the parameter estimation in single-cell mode, allowing for the simulation of single-cell sequencing and generation of pseudo-bulk data thereof. 

### Analysis and plots

Once the parameter estimation has been finished, extract .csv-files from the .db files using the function abc-export. The fits can then be inspected using the script (Analysis_and_plots/Plot_fits_published_data.R)[Analysis_and_plots/Plot_fits_published_data.R].

This script
- plots model vs data for each sample (as shown in **Fig. 3b,f,l, Fig. SXX**)
- classifies individual cases as neutrally evolving or selected (as shown in **Fig. 3c,g,m**)
- computes highest density estimates for the parameters (as shown in **Fig. 3d,j,n,o**)
- compares the estimated age of the selected clones to the original studies (as whon in **Fig. 3h**).
