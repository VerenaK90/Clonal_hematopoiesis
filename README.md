Download and install python3 and pyABC von your computer.

Associated data can be found on Mendeley (doi: 10.17632/yvxdb7t3yk.1).

To reproduce the analysis, please check the file structure and make sure the required scripts and input files are in the correct location.

## Variant allele frequencies shaped by drift and selection in homeostatic tissues

SCIFER predicts that drift and selection shape the variant allele frequency distribution distinctly. We predict VAF distributions for different parameter sets and time points in the script [Theoretical_model_performance.R](Analysis_and_figures/Theoretical_model_performance.R). The script also produces the figure panels in **Figure 1** and **Supplementary Fig. 1**.

## Simulated data

### Tree and VAF simulation

To test the ability of SCIFER to distinguish selection and drift dynamics, we simulated division trees. Of these, we simulated WGS data by binomial sampling of a simulated bulk sample and applied SCIFER to these data. To reproduce the analysis, run the scripts [Neutral_tree.R](Simulated_data/Neutral_tree.R) and [Selected_tree.R](Simulated_data/Selected_tree.R) to simulate neutrally evolving trees and trees with a selected clone instigated at 20 years. To generate the VAF distributions which were used to assess the performance of SCIFER, run [Study_design.R](Simulated_data/Study_design.R), which adds binomial noise to the simulated VAFs and generates the simulated data sets as outlined in (MetaData/Sample_information_simulated_data.xlsx). To simulate a phylogenetic tree with both stem and progenitor cells as described in Supplementary Note 1, run the script [Neutral_tree_S_P.R](Simulated_data/Neutral_tree_S_P.R). This script also produces the plots shown in Supplementary Figure 1.

### Parameter estimation

To estimate the model parameters, we used SCIFER in conjunction with pyABC. To re-run the analysis refer to the folder (Parameter_estimation) and modify Parameter_estimation/Run_model_sim*x.R according to the sample specification. Specifically, you should provide the following information:

- `patient.id`, the ID/name of the analyzed subject
- `age`, the age (in days, can be retrieved from Sample_information_simulated_data.xlsx)
- `snvs`, a named list containing data frames with VAF and Depth information for each individual (e.g., as provided in RData/Simulated_data/SNVs_90x.RData)
- `depth`, the sequencing depth used to generate the data 
- `min.vaf`, the smallest VAF in the data that is to be compared to the model. Defaults to 0.05; we used `min.vaf=0.05` for all instances except for single cell WGS and simulated data with 270x, where we used `min.vaf=0.01`.
- `min.clone.size`, the minimal clone size that can be detected by the model. Defaults to 0.05; we used `min.clone.size=0.05` for all instances except for single cell WGS and simulated data with 270x, where we used `min.clone.size=0.01`.
- `min.prior.size`, the lower limit of clone sizes scanned by the parameter estimation. Parameter sets associated with clones < min.clone.size will be evaluated with the neutral model. Defaults to 0.01; we used `min.prior.size=0.01` for all instances except for single cell WGS and simulated data with 270x, where we used `min.prior.size=0.001`.
- `use.sensitivity` should sequencing sensitivity information be included in addition to binomial sampling? Defaults to `F`; if `T`, a matrix `false.negative.per.vaf` with columns corresponding to the measured VAFs and rows corresponding to individual measurements of the false negative rate at this VAF in addition to binomial noise must be provided. We used `use.sensitivity=F`.

The script Run_model_sim*x.R is to be sourced by [ABC_fit.py](Parameter_estimation/ABC_fit.py). Hence, please also modify the paths in this file. The python script also contains the definition of the prior distributions. Note that we chose priors running between 0 and 0.99 for `s` and between 0 and 1 for `t_s`, but these values are relative values only that will be converted into absolute values in the model script [Bayesian_fit.R](Parameter_estimation/Bayesian_fit.R). Specifically, the minimal and maximal values of `s` and `t_s` are chosen such that the clone has a minimal size of `min.prior.size` and a maximal size of 1. Analogous conversion of these two parameters into absolute values is also necessary when inspecting the parameter estimates later on (refer to [Analyze_and_plot_fits_sim_data.R](Analysis_and_figures/Analyze_and_plot_fits_sim_data.R)).
  
### Analysis and plots

Upon parameter estimation, the posterior probabilities (which can be downloaded from Mendeley) were analyzed using the script [Analyze_and_plot_fits_sim_data.R](Analysis_and_figures/Analyze_and_plot_fits_sim_data.R). This script 
- plots for each instance the model fit and the highest density estimates of each parameter
- computes statistics of the fits - %posterior probability supporting the selection model and the neutral model
- evaluates true and false positives for different clone sizes and sequencing depths, constructs the corresponding ROC curves and computes the AUC at the selected operating point
- this script generates the figure panels for **Fig. 2**.

## Published single cell WGS data

We tested our model on pseudo-bulk WGS data from published single-cell WGS data of three studies, Lee-Six et al., Nature, 2018, Mitchell et al., Nature, 2022 and Fabre et al., 2022. In a first step, we generated the pseudo-bulks for each study as outlined in the following.

### Generation of pseudo-bulk data 

#### Lee-Six et al.
Download the data from https://doi.org/10.17632/yzjw2stk7f.1 and store them in ./Published_data/Lee-Six_et_al/Caveman/. In addition, download the re-called data from our repository (https://doi.org/10.17632/yvxdb7t3yk.1) and store them in ./Lee-Six_et_al/Mutect_Strelka.

The script [Pseudo_VAFs_LeeSix_et_al.R](Data_preprocessing/Pseudo_VAFs_LeeSix_et_al.R) first compares the results of Caveman and Mutect/Strelka (**Extended Data Fig. 2b,c**). Thereafter, it generates the pseudo-bulk data and plots the VAF distributions as shown in **Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 2d**. Finally, it stores two list objects containing the VAFs in [Caveman/SNVs.RData](RData/Lee-Six_et_al/Caveman/SNVs.RData) and [Mutect_Strelka/SNVs.RData](RData/Lee-Six_et_al/Mutect_Strelka/SNVs.RData). Alternatively, these objects can be directly downloaded from Mendeley.

#### Mitchell et al.

Download the data from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/np54zjkvxr/1 and structure them like: ./Published_data/Mitchell_et_al/*/.

The script [Pseudo_VAFs_Mitchell_et_al.R](Data_preprocessing/Pseudo_VAFs_Mitchell_et_al.R) generates the pseudo-bulk data and plots the VAF distributions as shown in **Fig. 3h, n, Extended Data Fig. 2e, f**. It also plots the trees as shown in **Fig. 3g, m**. Finally, it stores a list object containing the VAFs for each sample in (SNVs.RData)[RData/Mitchell_et_al/SNVs.RData]. Alternatively, this object can be directly downloaded from Mendeley.

#### Fabre et al.
Download the data of id2259 from doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.15029118 and structure them like: ./Published_data/Fabre_et_al/*/.

The script [Pseudo_VAFs_Fabre_et_al.R](Data_preprocessing/Pseudo_VAFs_Fabre_et_al.R) generates the pseudo-bulk data and plots the VAF distribution as shown in **Extended Data Fig. 2g**. It also plots the trees as shown in **Extended Data Fig. 2g**. Finally, it stores a list object containing the VAFs in [SNVs.RData](RData/Fabre_et_al/SNVs.RData). Alternatively, this object can be directly downloaded from Mendeley.

### Parameter estimation

As with the simulated data, we used SCIFER in conjunction with pyABC to estimate parameters. To re-run the analysis refer to the folder [Parameter_estimation](Parameter_estimation) and modify [Run_model_scWGS.R](Run_model_scWGS.R) according to the sample specification, with emphasis on the following information

- `patient.id`, the ID/name of the analyzed subject
- `age`, the age (in days; can be retrieved from MetaData/Sample_info_published_data.xlsx)
- `snvs`, a named list containing VAF information for each individual (e.g., provided in RData/Mitchell_et_al/SNVs.RData)
- `depth`, the sequencing depth used to generate the data; can be arbitrarily set here, as we will use the "sc" mode (see below, `seq.type`)
- `min.vaf`, the smallest VAF in the data that is to be compared to the model. Defaults to 0.05; we used `min.vaf=0.01` due to the high pseudo-bulk coverage.
- `min.clone.size`, the minimal clone size that can be detected by the model. Defaults to 0.05; we used `min.clone.size=0.01` due to the high pseudo-bulk coverage.
- `min.prior.size`, the lower limit of clone sizes scanned by the parameter estimation. Parameter setzs associated with clones < min.clone.size will be evaluated with the neutral model. We used `min.prior.size=0.001` due to the high pseudo-bulk coverage.
- `ncells`, the number of sequenced cells
- `seq.type`, has to be set to `seq.type="sc"`, as we analyze pseudo-bulks from single-cells
- `use.sensitivity` should sequencing sensitivity information be included in addition to binomial sampling? Defaults to F; if T, a matrix `false.negative.per.vaf` with columns corresponding to the measured VAFs and rows corresponding to individual measurements of the false negative rate at this VAF in addition to binomial noise must be provided. We set `use.sensitivity=F`.

In comparison to bulk WGS data sequenced at 90x, we here lowered the lower VAF limits, as the single-cell sequencing data provide higher resolution. Moreover, we specified the number of sequenced cells and run the parameter estimation in single-cell mode, allowing for the simulation of single-cell sequencing and generation of pseudo-bulk data thereof. 

The script [Run_model_scWGS.R](Parameter_estimation/Run_model_scWGS.R) is to be sourced by [ABC_fit.py](Parameter_estimation/ABC_fit.py). Hence, please also modify the paths in this file. The python script also contains the definition of the prior distributions. Note that we chose priors running between 0 and 0.99 for s and between 0 and 1 for t_s, but these values are relative values only that will be converted into absolute values by the model script [Bayesian_fit.R](Parameter_estimation/Bayesian_fit.R). Specifically, the minimal and maximal values of s and t_s are chosen such that the clone has a minimal size of `min.prior.size and a maximal size of 1. Analogous conversion of these two parameters into absolute values is also necessary when inspecting the parameter estimates later on (refer to [Plot_fits_published_data.R](Analysis_and_figures/Plot_fits_published_data.R)).

### Analysis and plots

Once the parameter estimation has been finished, extract .csv-files from the .db files using the function abc-export (or directly download them from Mendeley). The fits can then be inspected using the script [Plot_fits_published_data.R](Analysis_and_plots/Plot_fits_published_data.R).

This script
- plots model vs data for each sample (as shown in **Fig. 3b,h,n, Extended Data Figs. 2d,f,g**)
- classifies individual cases as neutrally evolving or selected (as shown in **Fig. 3c,i,o**)
- computes highest density estimates for the parameters (as shown in **Figs. 3d-f,k,l,p**)
- compares the estimated age of the selected clones to the original studies (as shown in **Fig. 3j**).


## Bulk WGS data

### Data pre-processing

We ran the model on the filtered SNVs (called using Strelka and Mutect2, see manuscript for details), which we stored, for convenience, in the list object (./RData/WGS/SNVs.RData). 

### Parameter estimation

As with the other data types, we used SCIFER in conjunction with pyABC to estimate parameters. To re-run the analysis refer to the folder [Parameter_estimation](Parameter_estimation) and modify [Run_model_WGS_data.R](Simulated_data/Run_model_WGS_data.R) according to the sample specification, with emphasis on the following information

- `patient.id`, the ID/name of the analyzed subject
- `sort`, the cell sort to be analyzed ("CD34", "MNC", "MNC_minus_T" or "PB_gran")
- `age`, the age (in days)
- `snvs`, a named list containing a data frame with VAFs and depths for each individual, as provided in RData/WGS/SNVs.RData 
- `depth`, the sequencing depth used to generate the data 
- `min.vaf`, the smallest VAF in the data that is to be compared to the model. We used `min.vaf=0.05`, according to the detection limit of 90x WGS.
- `min.clone.size`, the minimal clone size that can be detected by the model. We used `min.clone.size=0.05`, according to the detection limit of 90x WGS.
- `min.prior.size`, the lower limit of clone sizes scanned by the parameter estimation. Parameter setzs associated with clones < min.clone.size will be evaluated with the neutral model. We used `min.prior.size=0.01`, according to the detection limit of 90x WGS.
- `use.sensitivity` should sequencing sensitivity information be included in addition to binomial sampling? Defaults to F; if T, a matrix `false.negative.per.vaf` with columns corresponding to the measured VAFs and rows corresponding to individual measurements of the false negative rate at this VAF in addition to binomial noise must be provided. We used `use.sensitivity=F`.

The script Run_model_WGS.R is to be sourced by [ABC_fit.py](Parameter_estimation/ABC_fit.py). Hence, please also modify the paths in this file. The python script also contains the definition of the prior distributions. Note that we chose priors running between 0 and 0.99 for s and between 0 and 1 for t_s, but these values are relative values only that will be converted into absolute values by the model script [Bayesian_fit.R](Parameter_estimation/Bayesian_fit.R).

### Analysis and plots

This script
- plots data only for the neutral cases (**Fig. 4c**)
- plots model vs data for each sample (as shown in **Figs. 4a, 5a, 6a, Extended Data Fig. 5**)
- classifies individual cases as neutrally evolving or selected (as shown in **Figs. 4b, 5b, 6b, Supplementary Fig. 2**)
- compares estimated clone sizes to VAFs of known drivers (**Fig. 5c**)
- computes highest density estimates for the parameters (as shown in **Fig. 4d, e, 5d, 6c, 7a-d**)
- compares the estimated parameters between samples with and without selection (as shown in **Fig. 5f-h**)
- computes the cumulative age-incidence of CH driver acquisition (**Fig. 7e**)
